# doggos-server
A node server to which pictures can be uploaded for display

Just a fun little project I made while experimenting with Express. Pictures are uploaded and pictures are displayed to visitors with a generated html page.

I'm pretty sure that I removed this from my website. It is not very secure. It pairs with a photo app that i created for android, but there is no ssh key or anything to check who is making an upload request. Until such security is in place, I'm not putting this online again.
